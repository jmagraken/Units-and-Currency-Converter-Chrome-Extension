# Units-and-Currency-Converter-Chrome-Extension

Chrome Extension designed to conveniently convert between imperial and metric units and global currencies.

Extension doesn't allow you to choose which units to convert into; this is to maximize efficiency for the user.

Extension will automatically convert into analogous units from opposite system (e.g. kilograms will be converted into pounds).

User may input measurement in a variety of formats (e.g. "12kg", "12 kg", "12 kilograms").

Currency exchange rates are retrieved using an API by APILayer. 

### To try extension, clone resository and open "popup.html".
